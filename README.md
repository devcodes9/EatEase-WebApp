# Food Subscription System
A solution to the common problem faced by working professionals and students who travel and do not have access to healthy and good quality food. Our proposed solution connects homemakers and home kitchens with those in need through a subscription-based system.

## Problem Statement
Poor diet on the job is costing countries around the world up to 20% in lost productivity, either due to malnutrition or obesity. Many students also avoid eating in hostel messes due to the lack of quality and taste. This leads to unhealthy eating habits and skipping meals. Our solution aims to address this problem and provide a healthy and cost-effective alternative.

## Solution
Our solution connects homemakers and home kitchens with students and working professionals in need of healthy food. Customers can subscribe to a kitchen of their choice with a plan (e.g. 15 days, 28 days, etc.). The kitchen just needs to make a little extra food each day to accommodate the customer's subscription. The food will then be delivered to the customer every day at a fixed time. Customers can cancel their subscription at any time in case of any issue with the food quality.

## Technology
We will be building a web app for our solution using MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS, and a cloud hosting service (GCP or AWS). Our development process will follow the software development life cycle rigorously to ensure a robust solution.

## Value Proposition
Our solution provides 360Â° value by integrating students/working professionals and kitchens on a single system. This innovation is easily adaptable and cost-effective, providing a meaningful experience to all entities involved.

## Conclusion
Our solution aims to address the common problem of lack of access to healthy food for those who travel for work or studies. Our subscription-based system connects homemakers and home kitchens with those in need, providing a healthy and cost-effective alternative.
